Translations
------------

Although there are currently no translations of this repository, they are very welcome. There is not yet any infrastructure for supporting translations through subdomains; we'll make it a priority as soon as someone starts working on one.

If you would like to contribute a translation to this project, please include a translated file that includes the language short code in the filename as this will be mapped to from the url. For example, fr.communitycodeofconduct.com will load the `index-fr.html` file.

Fork this project, send a pull request and I'll figure out how to make the translation go live (though the translation may be validated before publishing).

Please check the [issues](https://github.com/SamirTalwar/communitycodeofconduct.com/issues) to see if anyone else is currently working on a translation.


Background
----------

This repository is a fork of [confcodeofconduct.com](http://confcodeofconduct.com/) intended for communities of people, rather than organised conferences. The intent is to move the language toward communities, rather than conferences, but otherwise keep it in sync with the original.

Thanks very much to [Remy](https://twitter.com/rem) for setting up confcodeofconduct.com.

I'd like to continue using this as a simple go to reference for code of conduct for the communities in which I am involved&mdash;and equally, communities in which you're involved too.

This is *not* owned by me - this is a public resource - so if there's changes, please create a pull request, and if it makes sense, it'll be merged.

On that note - I'd rather not be the only person with merge permissions, so I hope that by the time you read this, I'm not the only person with those rights.
