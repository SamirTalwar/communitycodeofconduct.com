## Background

This repository is a fork of [confcodeofconduct.com](http://confcodeofconduct.com/) intended for communities of people, rather than organised conferences. The intent is to move the language toward communities, rather than conferences, but otherwise keep it in sync with the original.

Thanks very much to [Remy](https://twitter.com/rem) for setting up confcodeofconduct.com.

I'd like to continue using this as a simple go to reference for code of conduct for the communities in which I am involved&mdash;and equally, communities in which you're involved too.

This is _not_ owned by me - this is a public resource - so if there's changes, please create a pull request, and if it makes sense, it'll be merged.

On that note - I'd rather not be the only person with merge permissions, so I hope that by the time you read this, I'm not the only person with those rights.
