Changes made to the HTML markup or other formatting should be made to _src/index.html_.

Translations require:

1. The two letter [ISO-639-1][] language short code (`XX` in subsequent steps).
2. _src/content/XX.html_, based on _src/content/en.html_.
3. _src/titles/XX.html_, based on _src/titles/en.html_.
4. A line added to the list of languages in _main.tf_.

Once the translation is complete, raise a [pull request][pulls].

For translations to be merged, a +1 is need from an independent native speaker of that language.

Please check the [issues][] and [pull requests][pulls] to see if anyone else is currently working on a translation.
