<h1>Community Code of Conduct</h1>

<p>All members are required to agree with the following code of conduct. All members of the community are expected to enforce this code at every event, with help from the organisers. We are expecting cooperation from all participants in the community to help ensuring a safe environment for everybody.</p>

<p><em>tl;dr: Donâ€™t be a Jerk</em></p>

<h2>Need Help?</h2>

<p>The contact details of the organisers are on our website and in any emails we have sent.</p>

<h2>The Quick Version</h2>

<p>Our community is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of gender, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion. We do not tolerate harassment of community members in any form. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any community event, including talks, workshops, parties, or on Twitter and other online media. Participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the event and any future events <em>without a refund</em> (if applicable), or from the community itself, at the discretion of the organisers.</p>

<h2>The Less Quick Version</h2>

<p>Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.</p>

<p>Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.</p>

<p>Sponsors are also subject to the anti-harassment policy. In particular, sponsors should not use sexualised images, activities, or other material. Event hosts and attendees, including sponsors, staff and volunteers, should not use sexualised clothing/uniforms/costumes, or otherwise create a sexualised environment.</p>

<p>If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the organisers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the event or community with no refund.</p>

<p>If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact an organiser immediately. All of our organisers' contact details are listed on our website.</p>

<p>Organisers will be happy to help participants contact venue security or local law enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of the event. We value your attendance and contributions to the community.</p>

<p>We expect participants to follow these rules at all community events, whether professional, social or a mix of both.</p>
